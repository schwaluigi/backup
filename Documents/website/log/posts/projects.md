# projects
This section houses all of the projects I'm currently working on. bruh.

## what are you doing in my swamp?
Discovering new ways to be left alone is an ongoing project of mine, so I figured it warranted disscusion. So far, these are the methods I have implemented in my life:

1. Reducing the frequency of my showering to repel people away with body odor
2. Developing an abrasive personality to repel people away with  unlikeability
3. Living in a cave on the secluded Baltic Coast.

## writing this
While not a long-term project, you may have guessed that this version of the website is purely for testing purposes. In fact, I'm the only one reading this. Shit, it's getting meta. Every time I think about it, another layer gets added to the proverbial onion (is that the correct usage of the word *proverbial*? Does a well known quote from the hit film *Shrek* count as a proverb?). **AHHHHHH!**

## roguelike?
I was working on a roguelike, although at this point it's more of a curses walking simulator with a poorly implemented drunkards walk algotmith stolen from *Stack Overflow*. I've put it on hold to make this website, and I don't know if I'll ever pick it back up. ![](./../images/roguelike.png)
